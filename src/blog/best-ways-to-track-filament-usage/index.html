          Nothing ruins a 3D print like running out of filament halfway through. Yet most of us have no real idea how much material is left on any given spool. Here's a look at the different ways to track filament usage, from simple to sophisticated.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 1: Don't Track (The "Eyeball" Approach)</h2>

        <p>
          Let's be honest—this is what most people do. Look at the spool, make a guess, hope for the best.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Zero effort<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> You will eventually run out mid-print. Probably on that 18-hour print you really cared about.
        </p>

        <p>
          The visual approach is particularly unreliable because spool geometry is deceptive. A spool that looks half-full often has far less than 50% remaining—the inner layers hold less material than the outer ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 2: Slicer Estimates</h2>

        <p>
          Every slicer tells you how much filament a print will use. In theory, you could start with a full 1kg spool and subtract each print's usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> The data is already there in your slicer<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Slicer estimates aren't exact. Over time, small errors compound. Purge lines, failed prints, and filament changes aren't accounted for.
        </p>

        <p>
          This method drifts from reality within a few prints. You might think you have 200g left when it's actually 150g.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 3: Spreadsheet Tracking</h2>

        <p>
          Create a spreadsheet with columns for each spool: brand, color, material, starting weight, current weight. Update it after prints.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible, free, works exactly how you want<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires discipline. Spreadsheets on your computer aren't accessible when you're at the printer. Easy to forget to update.
        </p>

        <p>
          This works well for methodical people who already track things in spreadsheets. For everyone else, the spreadsheet gets neglected within a few weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 4: Weight-Based Tracking with a Scale</h2>

        <p>
          This is the most accurate approach: weigh your spool periodically and record the weight. A simple kitchen scale accurate to 1g is all you need.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Accurate, accounts for waste and failed prints<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> You need to actually weigh the spool and record it somewhere
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge is making the "record it somewhere" part fast enough that you'll do it. If updating your tracking system takes more than a few seconds, you'll skip it.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 5: Smart Filament Scales</h2>

        <p>
          Several companies sell scales that sit under your spool holder and connect to software to automatically track filament usage.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Automated tracking while printing<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Cost ($30-100+ per scale), only tracks the spool currently on the printer, requires software setup
        </p>

        <p>
          Smart scales work well if you have one printer and mostly print from one spool at a time. For multiple printers or frequent spool changes, you'd need multiple scales and the logistics get complicated.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 6: Printer Integration</h2>

        <p>
          Some modern printers (like Bambu Lab machines with AMS) track filament usage internally. The printer knows what material is loaded and estimates remaining filament.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Automatic, integrated into your workflow<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Only works with specific printer ecosystems, estimates can drift, doesn't help with spools in storage
        </p>

        <p>
          This is great for the spools actively loaded in your printer but doesn't solve the larger problem of tracking your full filament inventory.
        </p>

        <h2>Method 7: Dedicated Filament Tracking Apps</h2>

        <p>
          Apps specifically designed for filament inventory solve many of the pain points above. The best ones combine:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quick identification</strong> &mdash; Scan a QR code or NFC tag to pull up a spool instantly</li>
          <li><strong>Weight tracking</strong> &mdash; Log weights quickly without hunting through menus</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile access</strong> &mdash; Update from your phone while standing at the printer</li>
          <li><strong>Sync across devices</strong> &mdash; Data available everywhere you need it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Purpose-built for the task, minimal friction<br>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Another app to install, may have cost depending on the app
        </p>

        <h2>What Actually Works</h2>

        <p>
          After experimenting with most of these methods, here's what I've found:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Accuracy comes from weighing.</strong> Slicer estimates and guessing don't cut it. If you care about knowing how much filament you have, you need to weigh your spools.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Speed determines whether you'll do it.</strong> The best tracking system is one you'll actually use. If it takes more than 10 seconds to update a spool's weight, it won't happen consistently.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Identification matters at scale.</strong> With 5 spools, you can remember which is which. With 50, you need labels or tags. QR codes and NFC tags let you scan a spool and immediately see its details without searching through a list.
        </p>

        <h2>A Practical System</h2>

        <p>
          Based on the above, here's what works:
        </p>

        <ol class="space-y-2 my-6">
          <li><strong>Label every spool</strong> with a QR code or NFC tag when you add it to your collection</li>
          <li><strong>Record the starting weight</strong> (full spool) and empty spool weight for that brand</li>
          <li><strong>Weigh and update</strong> after prints, especially for spools that are getting low</li>
          <li><strong>Set low-stock alerts</strong> so you know when to reorder</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The key insight: make the update process fast. Scan a code, enter a number, done. That's achievable with a phone app. It's not achievable with a spreadsheet on your desktop computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your future self—the one staring at a failed print because the filament ran out—will thank you for setting up tracking now.
